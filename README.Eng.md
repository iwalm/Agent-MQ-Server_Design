<!-- <Technical Analysis of Server.pyde - Authored by Tian Jiaqi> -->

This is a C2 (Command and Control) server system based on the Flask framework.:

Main Functionalities:

    Provides 3 API endpoints:
        Send commands
        Receive responses
        Register agents
    Uses MySQL database to store agent registration data
    Implements asynchronous messaging via SQS
Applicable Scenarios:
    IoT device management
    Red team operations (penetration testing)
    Distributed task scheduling (scenarios requiring centralized control)
    
Code Characteristics Summary:
    Hybrid communication model:
        Asynchronous queue (SQS) + Synchronous HTTP (Flask)
    Stateless API with persistent database storage
    No authentication mechanism (security consideration)
    Hardcoded agent_id (static agent identification)

Key Technical Points:
    Asynchronous Communication
        Uses SQS to decouple server and agents, avoiding direct TCP connections
    Data Persistence
        MySQL ensures agent registration data is retained
    Lightweight Protocol
        JSON format balances readability and transmission efficiency
